  <p>
    <p> In this work, we mainly discuss the topic on intersective sets over ablian groups. The function D(G,J,N) is the maximum size of subset A of G^N such that A-A and J^N have no non-trivial intersection. We generalize and improve the relevant results by Alon and by
Hegedus via building a bridge between this problem and cyclotomic polynomials. Our new results include:
		(1)Finding infinitely many classes of groups G and subsets J, for which the upper bound by Alon and by Hegedus (using linear algebra method) can be improved exponentially. We also provide a systematical approach to searching such pair of G and J.
		(2)When J={0,1}, G=F_{p}^{N}, we improve the previously known upper bound obtained by Huang-Klurman-Pohoata. The main tools for this part is Berry–Esseen theorem and a local limit theorem of Gnedenko in probability theory </p>

    <p> In this work, we consider the  Erdos-Falconer distance problem under Hamming distance, which is the most important metric in coding theory. We show a non-trivial bound for the threshold on the cardinality |I| so that ∆(I) contains a positive proportion of the whole distance set. To prove our main result, we take advantage of some techniques from coding theory, extremal combinatorics (dependent random choice), and some results from number theory.</p>

    <p> In this work, we use the random algebraic method to construct several multi-hypergraphs. There are three major ingredients. First, the random multi-hypergraph is the union of several random hypergraphs, which are defined by some bounded-degree random
polynomials. Hence we can estimate the expectation of number of single edges and multiple edges, respectively. Second, due to the independence between different random hypergraphs, we can easily estimate the expectation of number of some structures, though the edges of such structures in multihypergraph are from distinct original random hypergraphs. The third ingredient is that, the random hypergraphs are defined by bounded-degree polynomials, we can define the bad structure in multi-hypergraph properly. Regarding the set of bad structures as variety and combining the Markov’s inequality, we can bound the expectation of
number of the bad structures.
		As a corollary of our main results, we demonstrate sharpness of the constant in the famous Kovari–Sos–Turan theorem.</p>

    <p> We prove that, in any proper coloring of a complete graph K_n if there are more than cn^{1+1/(2t-3)} colors with some constant c>0, then we can always find two vertex disjoint and color isomorphic copies of the 1-subdivision of complete graph K_t. This result answers a question of Conlon and Tyomkyn.   </p>
